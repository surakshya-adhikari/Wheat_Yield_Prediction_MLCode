## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting wheat yield in specific regions using data-driven insights. Our aim is to help farmers, agriculturalists, and policymakers optimize crop production by providing accurate forecasts that account for factors like weather conditions, soil quality, and historical yield data. With the growing demand for sustainable and productive farming practices, this project highlights the importance of machine learning in agriculture.

## How It Works
We use machine learning algorithms to analyze various datasets containing historical weather patterns, soil health metrics, and past wheat yields. By training our model on this data, we can predict future yields under different conditions. Our methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, ensuring that our model is both accurate and generalizable. The model will enable farmers and decision-makers to better plan resource allocation, adapt to potential challenges, and ultimately maximize wheat yield.
